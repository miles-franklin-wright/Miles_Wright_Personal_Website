      <h1>Hundred Days of Code</h1>
      <h2>My journey to full stack development</h2>
      <h3>Day One</h3>
      <h4>July 15th, 2022</h4>
      <p>Although I began learning how to code two years ago, I have failed to produce a personal website. Until now, I have doubted myself and my ability to consistently craft myself into a strong coder. I have had my achievements thus far, but have had triple the failures preceding them. Sometimes the most difficult tasks in life are those that prove to ourselves that we can be the people we imagine ourselves as.</p>
      <p>The point of this exercise is going to be to create a great personal website. The commitment is that I code something every day, no matter how little. In the past I have had issues with overcommitting to projects or deadlines that are simply too difficult. To combat this, every 10th day, I will be giving myself two goals set five and ten days away that must be pushed regardless of how poorly I implement them. Lastly, I would like to become better at being proud of my work, so at the beginning of each 10 day period, I will take a moment to highlight one aspect of the process I thought I did really well. These are the only rules and requirements.</p>
      <p>The Day 1 contribution is this entry, and the new section containing it.</p>
      <p>Since today is the first day of the 10 day period, I'll set out the goals for day 5 and day 10. The day 5 goal will be to have the published github hosted version of the site. It doesn't matter how good or bad it looks. Just to have that done will be enough. The day 10 contribution will be to take the published site and put it on my CV, LinkedIn, and all of my other platforms. This website is not just an exercise; it's a core project and I need accountability if I'm going to do that.</p>
      <p>We'll see what tomorrow holds.</p>
