        I study International Relations and Sustainable Development, but I have also been learning programming and supplementing my data analysis skills since the summer of 2020.

        I have a wide range of interests, from the relationship between neopatrimonial extractive economies and colonial history, to analyzing which teams have the most consistent cross country results in my home state, to trying to recycle my aluminum and glass waste in my house. Although these interests naturally fall into categories of IR & SD (my degree), programming and data analysis, and 'hobbies', I would love to find work that synthesizes at least some of the elements of each.

        Currently, I'm looking for work out of university. As you can see, I have a wide range of analytical and practical skills, but what I'd like to emphasize more is my flexibility and motivations. I have picked up projects, roles, and duties throughout my time at university simply because I wanted to do something different and do it well, or because I couldn't stop myself from trying. My motivations and my flexibility to follow them haven't changed. For employers, I want to work for you because I believe you're doing something worthwhile that I can contribute to. For collaborators, let's work together to complete projects that can help people and our planet.
